        "\n",
        " - A random variable is a function that assigns numerical values to outcomes of a random experiment. For instance, rolling a die results in outcomes like 1, 2, 3, and so on. It helps quantify randomness by associating real numbers with uncertain events. Random variables are essential in statistical analysis and probability theory. They are categorized into discrete and continuous types based on the nature of their possible outcomes."

A continuous random variable, on the other hand, can take any value within an interval, like the time it takes to complete a task. Each type of random variable is used to model different real-world situations involving uncertainty."
